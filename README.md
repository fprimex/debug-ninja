## debug-ninja

A POSIX Bourne shell script for debugging UNIX-like systems.

## History

During my employment with Basho I wrote an information gathering script called
`riak-debug`, which shipped with Riak 1.4 under the Apache 2.0 license. This
script, `debug-ninja`, is a version forked from my last commit to that
`riak-debug`, with all of the Riak specific items removed. The end result is an
easy way to gather lots of generic information from a UNIX-like system.
